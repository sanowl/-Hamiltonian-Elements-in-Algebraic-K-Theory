# Hamiltonian Elements in Algebraic K-Theory

## Overview

This project implements the mathematical structures and concepts introduced in the paper "Hamiltonian Elements in Algebraic K-Theory" by Yasha Savelyev. It explores the connection between symplectic geometry and algebraic K-theory, introducing novel concepts such as Hamiltonian elements in categorified algebraic K-theory.

## Key Mathematical Concepts

### 1. Hamiltonian Fibrations

Hamiltonian fibrations are central geometric structures in this theory. They are fiber bundles ֒M → P → X, where:
- M is a symplectic manifold (the fiber)
- X is the base space
- The structure group is contained in Ham(M, ω), the group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of M

These fibrations act as a bridge between symplectic geometry and algebraic K-theory.

### 2. Categorified Algebraic K-Theory

This is an extension of classical K-theory, incorporating:
- A∞ categories
- Waldhausen constructions

For a ring k, an infinite loop space K_Cat(k) is constructed using the Waldhausen S-construction on a category of pretriangulated A∞ categories over k.

### 3. Fukaya Functors

For each Hamiltonian fibration P, a functor is constructed:

F_P : Δ(X_•) → A∞Cat_Z2_k

This functor associates A∞ categories to the simplices of the base space X, capturing the symplectic geometry of the fibration.

### 4. U-map

A map is constructed:

U : BHam(CP^n, ω_FS) → K_Cat,Z2(k)

This map connects the classifying space of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms to the categorified K-theory space.

### 5. Mirror Symmetry Extension

An extension of homological mirror symmetry to the algebraic K-theory context is proposed. This includes:
- Equality of classes [Fuk(M)] = [D^b(M_mirror)] in K_Cat_0(Λ)
- Correspondence between A-model and B-model K-theory classes

## Mathematical Details

### Waldhausen S-construction

The S-construction is a key tool in defining categorified K-theory. For a Waldhausen category C, a simplicial category S•C is constructed where:
- Objects in SnC are sequences of cofibrations in C
- Morphisms are commutative diagrams
- Face and degeneracy maps are given by omitting or repeating objects in sequences

### Characteristic Classes

For a Hamiltonian fibration P, characteristic classes in K_Cat,Z2_m(k) are computed. These classes are derived from the homotopy groups of BHam(CP^n, ω_FS).

### Conjecture on Injectivity

A key conjecture states that the map:

π_2k(|wA_Z2_Z|) → K_Cat,Z2_2k(Z) ⊗ Q

is injective for 2k ≤ 2n. This conjecture relates to the stability properties of the U-map.

## Future Mathematical Directions

1. **Injectivity of U-map**: Investigation of conditions under which U_m,* : π_m(BHam(CP^n, ω_FS)) → K_Cat,Z2_m(k) is injective.

2. **B-model Homotopy Classes**: Construction and study of 'B-model' homotopy classes in the context of mirror symmetry.

3. **K-theoretic Mirror Symmetry**: Development of a comprehensive K-theoretic formulation of mirror symmetry, extending beyond the derived category equivalence.

4. **Generalized Coefficient Rings**: Extension of the theory to more general coefficient rings, particularly in the context of Fukaya categories over Novikov rings.

5. **Higher Categorical Structures**: Investigation of the role of (∞,1)-categories and (∞,2)-categories in this framework.
